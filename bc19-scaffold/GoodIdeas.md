# Ideas worth considering

+ [HalfVoxel2018](https://github.com/HalfVoxel/battlecode2018/blob/master/README.md) Potential rush strategy: Instead of building a factory near our starting position, let a worker go to the enemy and build it there instead. This way we can still build a good economy in the beginning of the game, while still being able to attack the enemy early.
